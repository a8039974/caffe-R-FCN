This branch of Caffe extends [BVLC-led Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) by adding other functionalities such as managed-code wrapper, [Faster-RCNN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf), [R-FCN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06409v2.pdf), etc.
And it has been modified to be complied by c++4.4 and glibc 2.12.

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like

- [Tutorial Documentation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/)
- [BVLC reference models](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html) and the [community model zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo)
- [Installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)

and step-by-step examples.

## Linux Setup

### Pre-Build Steps
Copy `Makefile.config.example` to `Makefile.config`

### CUDA
Download `CUDA Toolkit 7.5` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
The code doesn't support the CPU_ONLY.


### cuDNN
For cuDNN acceleration using NVIDIA’s proprietary cuDNN software, uncomment the ```USE_CUDNN := 1``` switch in Makefile.config. cuDNN is sometimes but not always faster than Caffe’s GPU acceleration.

Download `cuDNN v3` or `cuDNN v4` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). And unpack downloaded zip to $CUDA_PATH (It typically would be /usr/local/cuda/include and /usr/local/cuda/lib64)

### Build

Simply type
```
make -j8 && make pycaffe
```
